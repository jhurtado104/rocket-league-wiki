# Rocket League Wiki Website
This Rocket League webiste is divided into four main navigation areas and my main goal was to explain a well known video game, Rocket League, to someone that doesn't know anything about the game. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the website.

## Home

The home page has two videos that can be played and gives the user an overview or idea about what the game is about.
<br>
## About
![About Page Screenshot](/RL/Screenshots/about-page-screenshot.jpg "About Page Screenshot")
In the about section, I explain a little bit about the history behind Rocket League and how it became to be. I provide information about the traditional gamemodes and alternative gamemodes. 
<br>
## Ranks

In addition to the core gamemodes, the developers implemented a competitive side of the game. I explain the different types of ranks and a glimpse of how the calculations that goes on behind the scenes to determine each players rank. In the table, I go over all of the ranks and MMR. I made a text box below the table that can be used to calulate what rank a player is or what there MMR would be in the 3v3 competitive gamemode. It is different for each competitive gamemode so I decided to go with the most popular gamemode at the time which was the 3v3 competitive playlist.

## Vehicles

The Vehicles page I showed off some of the cars that the game offers to beggining players. I made the car images visible to see when the user clicks on the image they wish to see and also provided pictures on how each car would look on each team.
